## traxter_help_rosbag Package

This package's purpose is to contain nodes useful for data analysis or offline processing. 

For example, re-timestamp the most recent laser scan to the current time step (useful for rosbag analysis); publishing the imu contents in euler angles instead of quaternion; estimate the wheel-speeds based on encoders; etc.
